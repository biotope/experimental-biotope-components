# AngularSample for Biotope Components

First install dependencies using `npm install` in the `angular folder`. You also need to build the Biotope resources.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Contributions

This example demonstrates how to

- import Biotope components into an Angular application (see `app.module.ts`)
- use Biotope components in a template (see `app.component.html`)
- interface with Biotope components using properties for input and events for output (see `app.component.html` and `app.component.ts`)
- nest Biotope and Angular components (again, see `app.component.html`).
